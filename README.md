## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## App Requires the Mock-API provided by Norigin Media:

This API provided by Norigin Media Angular App fetches data from this API.

This is packaged as a standard Node NPM module. To install simply run: `-> npm install` from the project root directory.
Of course Node.JS should be installed beforehand. For Native Developers not familar with NPM here is the [NPM Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

To run the update & run mock-api server execute the command below:

```
-> npm run start
```
You should see the server start on port 1337.
```
Mock service running at http://localhost:1337
```
You can now request data from the mock-api: 
`Try It: http://localhost:1337/epg`
